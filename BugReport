These are the bugs found when running the app on my laptop. Things might be different on other machine.

Bug report:

	1. There are 2 notifications appear when a Rider creating a request and leaving the Request Fare
	blank, while there is only 1 notification when he/she editing an existing request and changing the
	fare to blank. Are these 2 notifications both necessary?

	2. In profile editing, user is able to input his mobile number as none number. Similarly, in Driver's
	request accepting page, Driver is able to input a negative number for radius.

	3. In Driver's search, whether I input a price that is more or less than the original price, the filter
	clears the search result list.

	4. A user use as Driver can accept the request made by himself as a Rider. Is this a problem?

	5. When a request is accepted on both sides and it is deleted by the Rider, the request does not disappear
	immediately but remains unable to enter until the page is refreshed so that the request disappears.
